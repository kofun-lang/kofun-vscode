# The server is not vendored in git on purpose. `tests/lsp/check.sh` in
# hjosugi/kofun requires the bundle to equal that repository's
# `tooling/typed-sidecar/{from-stage2,codec}.mjs` byte for byte, and only a
# checkout that owns those files can prove it. Copying the built result here
# and calling it verified would be a claim this repository cannot make.
