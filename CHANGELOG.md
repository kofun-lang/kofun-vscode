# Changelog

All notable changes to the Kofun VS Code extension.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **`scripts/vendor-server.sh` copies every server module.** Its fixed list
  predated the server's `import-target-index.js` and `visibility.js`, so a
  checkout pinned after those modules shipped packaged a server that failed at
  startup with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND: ./import-target-index.js`. It now copies the
  server's `.js`/`.mjs` files.

### Changed

- **The pinned `vendor/kofun` server is bumped** from `36122806` (the split
  commit) to `460f3c79`.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-08-08

### Changed

- **The marketplace identity is `hjosugi.kofun`.** The manifest published as
  `kofun-language-project.kofun-language-bootstrap` while
  `docs/LINGUIST_RECOGNITION.md` in `kofun-lang/kofun` recorded
  `hjosugi.kofun`;
  both could not be true and nothing forced the choice. `publisher.name` is the
  marketplace `itemName` — the page URL, the `--install-extension` argument,
  and what every installed copy updates against — and it is permanent, so this
  had to be settled before the first publish rather than corrected after.
  The manifest test now pins the pair and requires the README to state it, and
  the VSIX filename is derived from the manifest instead of a literal.
- **Split out of `kofun-lang/kofun` into its own repository.** The language, the
  toolchain and the language server stay there; this repository holds the VS
  Code client and its release pipeline. The server is pinned as a submodule and
  copied in at build time rather than committed, because the gate proving its
  semantic bundle matches the typed-sidecar sources byte for byte can only run
  in the repository that owns those sources.
- **Releases are built and published per platform.** The bundled server loads a
  natively compiled bridge, so an untargeted VSIX installs on machines where
  the server then answers every request with `null`, showing neither an error
  nor the syntactic fallback. Builds are now stamped with `--target` for
  `linux-x64`, `darwin-x64` and `darwin-arm64`.

### Fixed

- The end-to-end client test exited 0 when the server it launched died at
  startup: nothing kept the event loop alive, so node drained it and left the
  test pending and silent. It now starts from a failing exit code and reports
  what happened.

## 0.4.0

Editor features, all served by the bundled language server and all restricted
to what the validated typed sidecar or the labelled syntactic fallback can
actually support.

### Added

- **Inlay hints.** The callee's parameter name and its `read`/`edit`/`take`
  mode are shown at each call argument, so `process(data)` reads as
  `process(take data:)` without opening the callee. A `let` with no written
  type shows the inferred one. Each of the three is switchable under
  `kofun.inlayHints`.
- **Completion** over the names visible at the cursor, resolved by the same
  rules go-to-definition uses. Items state whether their type came from the
  validated sidecar or the syntactic fallback, and a fact from a document that
  is still failing is marked provisional.
- **Document outline**, nesting each function's parameters and locals under it.
- **Find all references** and **occurrence highlighting**, both shadow-safe.
- **Signature help** with the active parameter tracked across nested calls.
- **Folding ranges** for blocks and for runs of comment lines.
- **Selection ranges** expanding from the token through each enclosing block.
- **Semantic tokens.** Names are coloured by what they resolved to rather than
  by their spelling, so a parameter and a local sharing a name are drawn
  differently, declarations carry a declaration modifier, and builtins carry
  `defaultLibrary`. An unresolved name is left to TextMate rather than coloured
  as a guess.
- **Rename** for locals and parameters, rewriting the declaration and every use
  in one edit. It refuses a name that is a keyword, a builtin, not a valid
  identifier, or already visible where the old one is used — that last case
  would capture a different declaration.
- **Tasks** for `kofun check`, `build`, and `test`.
- **Snippets** for the declaration forms, including one per ownership mode.
- **Commands** to restart the language server and open its output, and a
  status-bar item reporting whether the server is starting, running, or stopped.

### Not included, deliberately

- No code-action provider. No diagnostic in the repository's registry carries a
  remedy today, so the capability would advertise a quick-fix list the server
  can never fill.
- No completion trigger characters. Member and field completion is not
  implemented, so `.` must not promise a list that cannot be produced.
- No problem matcher on the tasks. The CLI reports byte offsets rather than
  line and column, so a matcher would place every problem on the wrong line;
  diagnostics come from the language server, which converts those spans
  correctly against the open document.
- No renaming of functions or types. They can be named from a file this server
  never reads, so a rename would edit some uses and silently leave others
  behind. The request is refused with that reason rather than performed
  partially.
- No formatter and no workspace symbols. There is no `kofun fmt`, and the
  server does not read unopened files, so a workspace symbol list would be
  silently partial.

## 0.3.0

- Diagnostics, go-to-definition, and hover types from one validated in-memory
  typed sidecar, with a visibly labelled syntactic fallback outside the bounded
  producer profile.
- `.kofun` language registration, comments, brackets, indentation, and TextMate
  highlighting.
